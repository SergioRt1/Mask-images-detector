## Analysis and predictions in a communication network of researchers via email

***Authors:**  Luis Felipe Díaz Chica, Sergio Andrés Rodriguez Torres*
*All this work is the result of the course Machine Learning on graphs at Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería Julio Garavito and the Master in Informatics*

All to the coming content is an effort to analyze a real network which describes the communication between researchers of a European university via email, all the researchers belong to one of the 42 departments of the university.

## Objectives
Using machine learning techniques and network science we want to:
* Predict future interactions between researchers of the university
* Predict a researcher's department.
